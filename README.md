# Hi there, I'm Kelvin 👋🏾

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I'm a Software Engineer focused on backend platforms, developer-experience tooling, and reliable CLI utilities. I love building clean, tested systems—especially React/Vite templates, Node.js CLIs, and validation tooling that make teams faster. 
    
I’m also passionate about building iOS mobile apps and have hands-on, self-taught experience creating projects with Swift/SwiftUI.
